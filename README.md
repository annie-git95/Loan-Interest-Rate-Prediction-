# Machine-Learning
This project aims at predicting the loan rate any application would get given certain variables. The metadata and the holdout set is provided. 

Step 1:
Cleaning and Data Preparation: There are several entries where values have been deleted to simulate dirty data. 
Note that some of the missing values are truly blank (unknown answers) and thus were impossible to clean; I used my discretion.

Step 2:
Model Building: Build Machine Learning/Statistical models in Python to predict the interest rate assigned to a loan.
When writing the code associated with each model, the first part produces and saves the model, 
followed by a second part that loads and applies the model.

Step 3:
Testing: Model were tested using data found within the "Holdout" file.
